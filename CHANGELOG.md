## [Unreleased]

## [1.0.0] - 2026-11-13

The first stable release: it installs with Composer's default minimum-stability (stable).

### Added

- Omnilab PubChem: a compound by CID, name, InChIKey, InChI, CAS number or SMILES - its computed
  properties with units (formula, weight, XLogP, TPSA...), synonyms, description, 2D structure image
  and its identifiers in ChEBI, ChEMBL, Wikidata, CAS, UNII, DSSTox and KEGG - through PubChem's
  PUG-REST, no key needed, at PubChem's pace.

### Release

- Requires `omnisense/omnilab` `^1.0`, stable versions, where it required `@dev` ones:
  `composer require omnilab/pubchem` installs in a project at Composer's default minimum-stability
  (stable). `extra.branch-alias` names the branch (`dev-1.x`: `1.x-dev`).
- CI: `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (glitchr-studio/ci's php-package.yml, pinned: the package
  installed alone, PHPUnit, PHPStan against its baseline, a consumer install) and `release.yml`
  (that CI on the tag, then glitchr-studio/ci's php-release.yml); `phpunit.xml.dist` runs the
  package's own tests.
- README: the install line and a first call.
